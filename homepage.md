### Spiel
Data science is about building data solutions that solve company challenges. 

It requires the buy-in, input, and work from lots of areas of the organisation, and doesn't succeed by buying an off-the-shelf product or hiring a PhD graduate in Machine Learning. It takes a while to get it working smoothly.

Locke Data is here to help you implement data science in your organisation so that it takes less time, fewer mistakes are made, and value is added sooner.

#### Data Science Readiness

Finding the right data science direction for your organisation is tough. It’s easy to get it wrong, or for it to take longer than it should.

Locke Data is here to help your organisation assess its current position and determine the right data science direction going forward.

Get started with a [Data Science Readiness Review](https://itsalocke.com/data-science-readiness-review/) to see where you need to go.

#### Build internally

Our philosophy at Locke Data is “build internally”. We believe that just hiring a lone data scientist results in poor outcomes for organisations.

You need to grow the knowledge of key stakeholders and supporting teams. You can invest in your existing analytical staff to build a data science capability with less risk and cost.

Get started by [training your BI people to use R](https://itsalocke.com/r-for-bi-people/), a core data science language.

#### Get feedback

It’s important to get feedback, especially when you’re first starting out.

Early in the data science journey, Locke Data can help you assess and improve the work you and/or your data science team is doing.

Get started with our [peer review](https://itsalocke.com/model-audits/) process.
